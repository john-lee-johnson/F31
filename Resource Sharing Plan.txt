Resource Sharing Plan
Data collected from these studies will be shared with the biomedical research community at large through oral and written presentations at scientific meetings. I anticipate to generate novel data that will result in publications in peer-reviewed journals by the end of this fellowship. Moreover, any Next Generation Sequencing data will be made publicly available on the Gene Expression Omnibus. In an effort to ensure reproducibility in our data, the computer code used to generate the data analysis will be fully commentated and distributed through online sites.
