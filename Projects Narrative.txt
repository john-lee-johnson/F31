Project Narrative:
The aims outlined in this application will elucidate the roles of pioneer transcription factors during lymphoid cell development. Cell-type specific genes must become accessible to the transcription factors that regulate them at the appropriate developmental stage. A special class of transcription factors, known as pioneer transcription factors, bind their consensus sequences on DNA that is wrapped around histone proteins and facilitate nucleosome ejection and stabilize the binding of other developmentally important transcription factors. To date, the transcription factors that regulate this process of opening the chromatin during lymphoid development have not been characterized. Our preliminary data suggests that, contrary to established dogma, cell-type specific genes in hematopoietic stem cells are not merely open and then later close as the cell continues to differentiate, but that these cell-specific genes become accessible only as the cell reaches terminal differentiation. Furthermore, the chromatin modifications at these cell-type specific genes are regulated in such a way that these genomic regions are poised during early stages of hematopoiesis and then later removed from irrelevant genes once a particular cell-fate decision has been made. Therefore, I propose to study the mechanisms of chromatin accessibility and the dynamics of histone modifications during lymphoid cell development, as this will undoubtably have broad applicability to human health, infectious disease, immunodeficiency, and cancer.
